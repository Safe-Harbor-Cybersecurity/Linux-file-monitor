# Linux-file-monitor

I'll create a monitoring script that checks critical files for modifications and alerts you to any changes. This can help detect potential security breaches or unauthorized modifications.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

This script creates a file integrity monitoring system. Here's how to use it:

1. Save the script to a file (e.g., `file_monitor.sh`)
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x file_monitor.sh`
3. Initialize the database: `sudo ./file_monitor.sh init`
4. Run checks: `sudo ./file_monitor.sh check`

Key features:
- Monitors critical system directories
- Creates SHA256 hashes of files
- Detects any modifications to files
- Logs changes with detailed information
- Sends alerts through multiple channels (email, desktop notifications, system journal)
- Records file permissions, ownership, and timestamps

To automate monitoring, add it to crontab:
```bash
# Check every hour
0 * * * * /path/to/file_monitor.sh check
```

Be sure to:
1. Modify the `WATCH_DIRS` variable to include your critical directories
2. Update the `EMAIL` variable with your email address
3. Secure the hash database and log files
4. Consider storing the hash database on a separate, secure system

Would you like me to add any additional security features or modify the monitoring parameters?​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
